# Statistical_learning_project
## INTRODUCTION

Our main interest behind working on this project was checking if the person will take a coupon or not. To do so, we relied on a dataset that includes details about the destination, the number of people in the car, the weather, the temperature, and other useful information that helps us know the problem and predict better.
We analyzed and found out how these variables interact with each other, which helped us predict if a new customer will take the coupon or not. In order to answer the question mentioned, we tried many models such as Lasso, Ridge and Elastic Net, which will be discussed in the report below, and chose the best one to fit our problem.


## Dataset
This data was collected via a survey on Amazon Mechanical Turk. The survey describes different driving scenarios including the destination, current time, weather, passenger, etc., and then ask the person whether he will accept the coupon if he is the driver.
